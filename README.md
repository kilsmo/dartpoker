# Dartpoker

Dartpoker currently implements a HandRank class and tests for the HandRank class.

A HandRank object describes the strength of a hand, for example a full house, kings over aces. Given five cards, the static function HandRand.create() creates a HandRank object.

## Todo

The HandRank class is not the end goal for DartPoker. The end goal is a working poker server with an easy to use poker client.
